## ❓ What is this?
The site can be found [here](https://palette-shift.web.app/).

This is not working very well, so I don't recommend using it... yet.

## 😵 Help! I have a question

[Create an issue](https://github.com/babichjacob/palette-shift/issues/new) and I'll try to help.

## 😡 Fix! There is something that needs improvement

I'm sorry, because of my skill level and the fragility of (the combination of) some of these tools, there are likely to be problems in this project. Thank you for bringing them to my attention or fixing them for me.
